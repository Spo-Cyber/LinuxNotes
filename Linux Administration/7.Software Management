		#Software Management
	
We are provided with the source files of the application, and in order to run it on our platform, we have to either compile the sources or install it from a binary package.
A binary package in the Linux context is an application package which contains executables as opposed to source code.
The executables are the outcome of the compilation process.

DPKG (for Debian based distros)
*info) the name deb , comes from Debra which is the wife's name of the Debian founder.)

Deb is the installation package format used by all Debian based distributions.This is an archive that contains other files, including the executable application that  was already compiled.
Package management operations can be performed with different tools available, from the lowest level command dpkg to apt or graphical front-ends like Synaptic.
Dpkg provides a low-level infrastructure for package management.The dpkg database contains the list of the installed software on the current system.
It can work with local .deb package files and does not know about repositories and does not solve dependencies like 'apt' does.
Note that other advanced tools like apt will call dpkg behind the scenes.So in fact , they are based on dpkg.
If you have a downloaded deb file , you can install it with dpkg.

dpkg --info fileName - to show info about deb file.
sudo dpkg -i fileName optionalMultipleFiles - to install application (only root can).
dpkg --get-selections - to list all installed programs on the system.
dpkg-query -l - to see the package version, the architecture and the short description.'ii' in the first column indicates the desired state which is 'install' and the packet  status which is 'installed'.
A Debian package is an archive , which contains other files. 
dpkg -L packageName - to list all the files installed on your system from the package.So to know the exact packageName need to run 'e.g. dpkg-query -l | grep google' and then paste that name after -L .
dpkg -S filePath - to see , to what package a specific file belongs to.

!If an important file got corrupted and you want to reinstall the package.
1. which -a firefox-esr - e.g. to know the exact location of firefox-esr command's file (/usr/bin/firefox-esr, /bin/ls/firefox-esr).
2. dpkg -S - to know the packagename of that application  (here packagename is firefox-esr)
3. sudo dpkg -r(--remove) nameOfPackage - remove the package , but does not remove the configuration file as well.
4. sudo dpkg -P(--purge) nameOfPackage - remove the configuration files as well.
However dpkg is a low-level tool that neither works with repositories nor solves dependency problems.So it's recommended to use 'apt' tool for package management.

#APT (Advanced package tool)

In the newest versions of debian based distros the apt-get and apt-cache tools were merged into a single command simply called apt.
Unlike dpkg, apt does not understand .deb files.It works with packages that are downloaded from repositories and calls dpkg directly after downloading the .deb archives.
An APT repository is a web server which contains a collection of packages with metadata that is readable by the apt tool.Having an APT repository, allows to perform package install, removal, upgrade, and other operations on individual packages or groups of packages.Repositories are essential for storing, managing and delivering software on Debian systems.
APT uses an index or a local database that holds records of available packages from the repositories enabled in the system.

!Execute as ROOT
apt update - to receive the latest changes from the apt repositories.It's recommended to run this command each time before installing or upgrading new packages.This command doesn't install or update any software application.It just updates the index.
apt install packagename's'- to install new application (e.g. apt install apache2).It will install the specified package and all its dependencies.
apt install packagePath - to install a deb package from local computer.If you don't specify the full path even without ./ , then it will search in it's repositories online.
apt full-upgrade - to upgrade all available packages.Add -y to answer yes to all prompts in installation.
apt remove packageName's' - to remove package.
apt purge packageName's' - to remove configuration files as well.
apt autoremove - to remove the no longer deeded dependencies .When a package is installed , it also installs it's dependencies.When the package is removed , using apt remove or purge, the dependencies will not be removed as well.You can always freely remove these dependency packages since they are no longer used!.
apt clean - to clear out the local repository of retrieved package files.By default, system keeps every package that has been downloaded  and installed in a cache directory on the disk. /var/cache/apt/archives is the cache directory , which contains all installed and upgraded packages.after apt clean , it only keeps the log files.
apt list - to get information about the available and installed packaged.Add --installed to get the installed packages.
apt search 'phrase' - to find packages whose description contains a word or a phrase.
apt show packageName - to view the information about a specific package. 
There are GUI applications such as aptitude or synaptic , which have user-friendly interface for packet management.

#Compiling Programs from Source Code

Advantages of compiling Source Code
1.You can compile applications with certain options which may be missing or disabled in the standard distribution package.For example if you want to install an FTP server and the IPv6 support is disabled in the binary package, you can download source code and compile the server with IPv6 enabled or vice versa.
2.Access to the latest version of an application.Imagine that a security bug was just discovered and the development team, has just released the source code of new version with the vulnerability patched.There may be some time between this moment and the time the distributor launches a binary package such as a Deb file.And in the meantime, you are not protected.If you want to have access to the latest release version, you have to compile the patched source code.This is at least temporary until the binary package is released!
3.It's possible to have multiple versions of the same program installed.

Disadvantages of compiling Source Code
1.The package manager will be completely unaware of the changes you have made. It won't be possible to update or remove the application  using the package manager.
2.If you are not careful when compiling to install the program in separate location you can break your system.
3.It's not the easiest job.

#Compiling C Programs

In sysadmin job you need to compile servers and these are programmed mostly in C and C++ programming language for maximum efficiency.
To be able to compile the source code, you need the gcc(GNU Compiler Collection) , which is a collection of compilers and libraries for C, C++ and Objective-C.
The default Debian repositories contain a metal package named build-essential that contains the compilers and lots of libraries , and other utilities required for compiling software.
Install it with 'sudo apt install build-essential'.It has three compilers gcc(GNU C Compiler) , g++(GNU C++ Compiler), and make is a utility used to build a collection of source files and transform them into the final product.
To create a basic C program and then compile it: create a hello.c , write a simple program, run 'gcc ./hello.c -o filename' to compile and save a binary file called filename , run ./hello.c and see the result.
