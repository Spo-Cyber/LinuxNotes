- - - - - - - #/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files - - - - - - -

/etc/passwd
Each line , is about a system or a normal user

mrhacker:x:1000:1000:MrHacker,,,:/home/mrhacker:/usr/bin/bash
*In 1st octet - (mrhacker) is the user's login name
*In 2nd octet - (x) means that password of the user is encrypted and saved in /etc/shadow file.If there is just a blank that means that user can login without password.
*In 3rd octet - (1000) is the user's ID "a positive integer number assigned to the user"
*In 4th octet - (1000) is the user's primary group ID "as third octet positive int"
*In 5th octet - (MrHacker,,,) is a comment.sometimes it is left blank
*In 6th octet - (/home/mrhacker) is the user's home directory
*In 7th octet - (/usr/bin/bash) is the default shell, usually set to bash.If instead of the shell, there is written false or nologin, that means that this user is not allowed to log into the system.

/etc/shadow
It stores the actual passwords of users in encrypted format

mrhacker:$y$j9T$5mwPtICgSiQS8m11UBqjY/$Ua53.mbL6hvOwH1QbbcwgfLGcQIwcNHpR0MadnIcMYC:20114:0:99999:7:::
*In 1st octet - (mrhacker) is the user name
*In 2nd octet - ($y$j9T$5mwPtICgSiQS8m11UBqjY/$Ua53.mbL6hvOwH1QbbcwgfLGcQIwcNHpR0MadnIcMYC) is the password.If the password octet contains *(asterisk) or an !(exclamation point), the user won't be able to login to the system using the password authentication.Usually the password format is set to $type$salt$hash.The $y in this case is the cryptographic hash algorithm used and can have the following values: 
1 -> MD5
2a -> Blowfish
3y -> Eksblowfish
5 -> SHA-256
6 -> SHA-512
y -> yescript

*In 3rd-9th octets - it contains last password changed time, password expiration time ...

The main purpose of the groups is to define a set of privileges or permissions like (read,write,execute) for a given file that can be shared among the users within the group.
There are 2 types of groups
1.The Primary Group - the group that is assigned to the files that are created by the user.
The group ID of the primary group is stored in /etc/passwd and the group name in /etc/group.
2.Secondary Groups - stored in /etc/group

"groups" command displays a list of all groups of the current user.The first group name is primary group , and rest of groups are secondaries.
groups username - to display a list of all groups of the username user
id - displays information about user and group etc. 

- - - - - - - - #Creating and Management of Accounts - - - - - - - - 

Everything by sudo command
- - - - - - - -
#Creating New User Account

useradd - to create a new user
useradd -m  - to create user's home directory as well, because it doesn't create a one for it.
useradd -m -d /path - to create user's home directory in specific location.
useradd -c "comment" - to set a comment/description which will be shown in /etc/passwd  
useradd -s /shellpath - to set default shell such as /bin/bash
useradd -g - to assign to a primary group (not common!)
useradd -G groupname,groupnamesoptional... - to assign to a secondary group (is common)
useradd -e 2002-04-23 username - to set expiring time for that user which will be temporary
useradd -alloptions username - to create user by username

adduser - useradd works at the back-end of adduser.just adduser is more user-friendly.but the useradd is must.
- - - - - - - -
#Password of user

passwd username - to set or change the user password
passwd -d username - to delete the password of user
chage username - to set account expiration date, specifying password changing information ...
- - - - - - - -
#Modifying User Accounts

Modifying its options we can by the same options of useradd
sudo usermod -c "change/set a comment" username
sudo usermod -g newprimarygroupname username
sudo usermod -G newsecondarygroup,orgroups
sudo usermod -aG newSecondayGroup - to add and not replace with old ones.
sudo usermod etc...

- - - - - - - -
#Deleting User Accounts

sudo userdel username "to delete the user account without it's related files"
sudo userdel -r username "to delete it's related files also"
(deluser - userdel works at the backend and it is more user-friendly like adduser and useradd)
- - - - - - - -
#Give administrative rights to user

By default a new user has not administrative rights, as it is not in sudo group, so any command by sudo won't work (sudo cat /etc/shadow won't work). 
sudo usermod -aG sudo username - To add the user into the group (run from the account which has administrative rights)
- - - - - - - -
#Group Management

groupadd groupname - to create a new group
groupmod -n newgroupname - to rename the group name
groupdel groupname - to delete the group
- - - - - - - -
