		#ShellGPT
		
ShellGPT is command line tool , built in Python , that uses the OpenAI API to leverage ChatGPT capabilities to generate shell commands, code snippets , or scripts.
It brings the AI power directly into your terminal.

Ensure that python pip (python package manager) is installed and is at the latest version => sudo apt install python3-pip
 1. mkdir ~/shellgpt
 2. cd ~/shellgpt
 3. python3 -m venv gpt_cli. It creates a new isolated Python environment in a folder named gpt_cli. You can use it to install packages without affecting your system-wide Python installation.Virtual Environment was created , but now it needs to be activated.
 4. cd gpt_cli/ && source bin/activate. To activate the virtual environment.So the prompt in terminal is now starting with the virtual environment name between parentheses.Note that the virtual environment is activated only for this session.So after closing the terminal , we will need to activate it again with same steps.
5. pip3 install shell-gpt . Now we install the shell-gpt.The next step is to create an open API key.ShellGPT uses the OpenAI API, which requires an API key.
6. Create an OpenAI account(platform.openai.com) , login, go to api-keys page (platform.openai.com/api-keys), create a new API key.Save the secret key , anywhere and if you will forget it, you can create a new one or revoke it.
7. export OPENAI_API_KEY=YourSecretAPIKey (The API key will be used by httpd and for that it should be set as environment variable.This command creates a new variable)
8. env (check if the variable was created and it has the desired value).All new variables created in the terminal are only temporarily stored for the current session.To permanently store a variable, you have to edit to an initialization file such as .bashrc.
9. nano ~/.bashrc -> go to the end of the file -> export OPEN_API_KEY=Yoursecretapikey (this makes the openapikey permanent).
