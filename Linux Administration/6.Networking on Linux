#Getting Information about the Network Interfaces(ip, ipconfig)

*If there are not net tools , run "sudo apt install net-tools".

- - -
*ifconfig: Part of net-tools package has been there for a long time and is still used to configure display and control network interfaces by many Linux administrators.
ifconfig - to show only the information about "enabled" interfaces.
ifconfig -a - to display a list of all network interfaces and the associated IP address , both "enabled/disabled"
ifconfig InterfaceName - to display only the information about specific interface.
__
*The list(each section of interface) starts with interface names, predictable by linux.
Interface name starting with "en" means Ethernet.
Interface name starting with "wl" means Wireless LAN.
Interface name "lo" means loopback address.
If Interface name contains "s"(slot number) , "p"(port number)
ifconfig displays neither the default gateway nor the DNS server.but 'route' command displays both.
__

- - -
*ip: New alternative of ifconfig from Iproute2 package.

ip a/ip address show/ip a show/ip addr show - to display a list of all network interfaces and the associated IP address.can omit the 'show' command , because it's the default.
ip -4 address - to display only IPv4 addresses
ip -6 address - to display only IPv6 addresses  
ip addr show dev InterfaceName - to display only the information about specific interface.
ip route show - displays the default gateway.

- - -
route - displays default gateway and DNS server.
route -n - displays names in numeric format.
__
'G' in 'Flags' column indicates that the line is displaying the default Gateway.

- - -
resolvectl status - to see the DNS servers used by the system.

#Configuring the Network On The Fly(ipconfig, ip, route)

*To configure the network interfaces with (ifconfig/ip), we need to execute the commands as ROOT.

*!Do NOT run the following commands on a remote system to which are connected using ssh, since you are going to disable and enable interfaces, change IP addresses and so on, and you ssh connection will drop around.

*After restarting the system, the changes in network configurations won't be saved.To permanently save the configurations , we need to use a "netplan" for static configuration of network.

- - -
*'Turn on/off the network interface'
ifconfig IntfName up - to enable the IntfName interface.
ifconfig IntfName down - to disable the IntfName interface.
__
*'Change the IP address'
ifconfig IntfName newIP up - to change the IP address.
__
*'Change the MAC address'
ifconfig Intface down -> ifconfig IntfName hw ether NewMAC -> ifconfig Intface up - to change the MAC address.so need to disable and then enable the interface.

- - -
*'Turn on/off the network interface'
ip link set IntfName up - to enable the IntfName interface.
ip link set IntfName down - to disable the IntfName interface.
__
*'Change the IP address'
ip address del IPaddress dev IntfName - to delete the new IP address.
ip address add IPaddress dev IntfName - to add the new IP address.If there is an IP, the 'add' adds the new IP as secondary IP.So to set it as primary we need to 'del'ete the primary to have only one, which also will be displayed in 'ifconfig'.
__
*'Add/delete the default gateway'
ip route add default via IPaddress - to add a new default gateway.
ip route del default via IPaddress - to delete specific default gateway.
ip route del default - to delete default gateway.
__
*'Change the MAC address'
ip link set dev IntfName address NewMAC - to change the MAC address.

- - -
*'Add/delete the default gateway'
route add default gw IPaddress - to add new default gateway
route del default gw IP address - to delete default gateway

#Setting Up Static IP(netplan)

*Netplan is the default configuration tool to manage networks.It uses yaml files that are located in /etc/netplan.

Netplan supports 2 renderers or backend services to control network interfaces.They are NetworkManager and Systemd-networkd.
The NetworkManager is mostly used on desktop machines while systemd-networkd is used on servers without a GUI.

The network interface can be managed either by network manager or by networkd, but not by both of them at the same time.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
'NetworkManager' is a service that manages network interfaces on a Linux system.
systemctl stop NetworkManager - stop network manager.
systemctl disable NetworkManager - disables network manager, even after restarting the system.
systemctl is-enabled NetworkManager - to check if is enabled.

After stopping the NetworkManager, create a 'yaml' file in /etc/netplan (e.g. /01-netconfig.yaml).The text content in that file is:

'For manual IP and DNS addresses'
network:
	version: 2
	renderer: networkd 
	ethernets/wifis:
		IntfName:
			dhcp4: false
			addresses:
				- 192.168.0.20/24
			gateway4: "192.168.1.1"
			nameservers:
				addresses:
					- "8.8.8.8"
					- "8.8.4.4"

'OR for automatically IP and DNS addresses by DHCP server'		
network:
	version: 2
	renderer: networkd 
	ethernets/wifis:
		IntfName:
			dhcp4: true


After changes run "netplan apply".

renderer: while written 'networkd' , netplan applies it as systemd-networkd automatically.

#Testing and Troubleshooting Network Connectivity

Ping works by sending ICMP echo request packets to the specified destination IP address and waits for a reply.When the destination receives an echo request packet, it will respond back with ICMP echo reply.Ping is also available on Mac and Windows , but with other options.
The domain name in ping can be different than the name that we have pinged, because an IP address can be set to multiple different domain names and ping performs a reverse DNS resolution , asking the DNS server configured on the system , "what is the domain of that IP".The DNS server responds back with one domain, which is differs from our input name.


ping [options] <destinationIP/domain name>
ping -n - To prevent ping from doing reverse DNS lookup.
ping -c N - To set the count of ICMP packets to be sent N times.
ping -i T - to set interval between each packet sending.by default it is 1s.Only superuser can send lower than 0.2s.
ping -q - display the summary only.

time=T ms(response time) -> time<30 means excellent, 50>time>30 means average, 100>time>50 means somehow slow and time>100 means slow response.
- - -
*Step 1 
ping DefaultGatewayIP -> If not working, then maybe not connected to AP.If working go to step 2

*Step 2
ping PublicIPAddress(e.g. DNS server) -> If not working, then maybe router is not properly connected or any issue with router.If working go to step 3

*Step 3
ping stableIPAddress(e.g. google.com) -> if not working, then you have a DNS issue.Check that you are using the correct DNS server and there's nothing that's filtering the packets and so on.Probably there's a configuration error related to DNS on you site or maybe the DNS server is down.
