#Scanning Networks with Nmap

Nmap(Network mapper) is a network discovery and security auditing tool, widely used by network administrators for many types of scanning.It's a complex , open-source application.
There are a variety of scans , that can be performed using nmap.
TCP Scans:
	SYN Scan: -sS (root only)
	Connect Scan: -sT

TCP scan is the default and the most popular scan option for good reasons.It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network , if there are no firewalls that restrict the scanning.It never completes the TCP connections.This technique is often referred to , as half open scanning because it doesn't open a full TCP connection.Nmap sends a SYN packet , as if it is going to open a real connection and then waits for a response.A SYN-ACK indicates that the port is listening, so it's open, while RST(Reset) indicates that the port is closed.If no responses received, the port is marked as filtered.You need root privileges to perform this type of scan.If you don't have root privileges , you can still perform another type of TCP scanning called TCP Connect Scan.
nmap - without any option, to check if it is installed(if not run "sudo apt install nmap").
Nmap is also available for Windows and Mac.And if you want a graphical interface, install Zenmap, which is the official nmap security scanner GUI.

nmap -sS destinationIP - TCP SYN scan.If you are root, and running nmap without any option,this is the default scanning type.It displays a lot of informationa bout destination host, how much time the scan took , the MAC address of the destination host, and the open ports.By default , nmap scans the most common one thousand ports for each protocol, TCP and UDP.If you are not root, you can't perform this scan.  
nmap -sT destinationIP - TCP Connect Scan.If you are not root , this is the default type of scan.

If nmap scans the most common one thousand ports for each protocol, then what if a service has been moved to a non-standard port like SSH is listening on port 50005‚ùì
Here we have to specify the non-standard port:
nmap -sS 192.168.1.100 -p 50005 - This will scan only the specified port.

We can specify multiply ports:
nmap -sS destIP -p 123,150-156,50005

nmap -sV destIP - does also version detection with default scan type.

nmap -p- - to scan all ports.If you press the Enter key while scanning, it will show how many percent of the entire scan process has been already performed.

- -
UDP Scan: -sU
UDP port scanning is generally slower and more difficult that TCP.UDP ports scanning is activated with the -sU.

- -
ICMP Scan: -sn or -sP
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24 - this sends ICMP packets to entire network.
