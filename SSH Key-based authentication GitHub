		#GITHUB: SSH key-based authentication
This lets you securely connect to GitHub(or other servers) without typing your password every time.Instead of a passwrd, you create a key pair: Private key(stays on your computer) and Public key(uploaded to GitHub).When you push or pull, GitHub checks if the private key on your machine matches the public key in your GitHub account.

1. Save your private key on your system:

If you have your private key as text (starts with -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----), save it to a file:
vim ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
-
If you don't have private key, then generate it, and and save to a file shown above:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  -t ed25519: uses modern secure algorithm
  -C: adds your email as a label
- - - - - - 
2. Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
- - - - - - 
3. Generate the public key from the private key
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
- - - - - - 
4. Copy and paste the public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Shows the public key. Copy this and paste it into GitHub under Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.

5. Test SSH connection to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com
