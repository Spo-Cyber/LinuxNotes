man -k 'keyword' = find keyword in all manual pages (alternative -> apropos 'keyword')
type 'x' = checking if a command is shell built-in or executable file
!abc = running the last command starting with 'abc'
!abc:p = printing the last command starting with 'abc'
!n('n'th code from history), !-n(the 'n'th code from the END of the history) ALTERNATIVE ctrl+r -> text, !! (rerunning the last code)
route -n (for printing the gateway ip address)
_________________
#HISTORY OPTIONS

history -c = to delete shell's history (for current session). ---> '> .bash_history' (for cleaning the entire bash's history)
history -d n = delete from bash_history the 'n'-th line(command) (!!not working on zsh but only on bash)
'whitespace somecommand' = to not save command in history
echo $HISTCONTROL (to look the HISTCONTROL variable)
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups  (for ignoring repeating commands)
HISTCONTROL=ignorespace (for ignoring the space at the beginning of command, because if the ignorespace is not there , the command won't be saved while starting with whitespace at the beginning of the command)
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T" (to show the time format in bash history 'day/month/year hour/minute/seconds')
If we want to make permanent changes for bash, then we need to type e.g. 'echo HISTTIMEFORMAT="%T" >> .bashrc' (to add the line to bashrc which will start the shell with it's configurations)
________________
#ROOT ACCESS

sudo su = switch to root user
id = to show the logged in user
sudo -v (to cache root credentials, to not require root password in each root required commands)
sudo -k (to invalidate root credentials, to ask the next time for root required commands)
sudo passwd 'username' (to create or change the password of username)
exit (to exit from root mode or ctrl+d)
lshw (to list all the hardware on device)
---------------------------
#FILE SYSTEM

!!! Everything in Linux is a file
- - - -
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

/bin (contains binaries or user executable files which are available to all users)
/sbin (contains applications that only the superuser(hence the initial s) will need)
/boot (contains files required for starting your system)
/home (is where you will find your users' home directories. Under this directory there is another directory for each user, if that particular user has a home directory.root has its home directory separated from the rest of the users' home directories and is /root)
/dev (contains device files)
/etc (contains most, if not all system-wide configuration files)
/lib (contains shared library files used by different applications)
/media (is used for external storage will be automatically mounted)
/mnt (is like /media but it's not very often used these days)
/tmp (contains temporary files, usually saved there by applications that are running.Non privileged user can temporarily save files there)
/proc (contains information about computer hardware e.g. CPU, RAM memory.The files and directories are generated , when computer starts or running and things
changes).E.g. to see info about cpu -> cat /proc/cpuinfo, or for memory -> cat /proc/meminfo
/sys (contains information about devices, drivers and some Kernel features)
/srv (contains data for servers)
/run (is new,different distribution use this directory in different ways.It's a temporary filesystem which runs in RAM so its contents will vanish when the system reboots.This directory is used only by processes)
/usr (contains many essential files and directores needed for the system to function properly in a multi-user environment)
/var (typically contains variable-length files such as logs which are files that register events that happen on the system)
- - - -
df (for file system space usage), df -h (for easier displaying like not in kilobytes but in Gb)
tree (for displaying directory tree), tree -f (also showing absolute paths of each directory and file), tree -d (list directories only)
sudo du -sh /path (to display the size of the path in human readable format)
_______
#ls command
ls (list directory contents) , ls /some/path (to list /some/path's list) and if just only ls then the list of the current directory
ls /path1 /path2 /path3 ... ~/path4 (to display n different paths at once),ls -R (to display the contents of all the directories in it 'RECURSIVELY')
ls /path -dl (only the /path directory and not it's content), ls -l (displays the content in long list format)
ls -S (sorts the files by size), ls --hide=[OPTION] e.g. ls --hide=*.conf (to display all content besides all .conf file)
ls -a (displays all files and directores includeing hidden ones), ls -1 (listing on a single column)
_______
#File Timestamps
date - for displaying system's current time

stat /path (displays the 'accessed(last time read), modified(last time got text change in it), changed(last time accessed,renamed,owner or group permission changed, timestamp changed - "so metadata changed")' timing parameters of files)
ls -lu (to see the access time)
ls -lt (to see the modification time)
ls -lc (to see the changed time)
ls -l --full-time (to display the full time including time zone,seconds and milliseconds)

touch filename -> if the file doesn't exist it will create a file by that filename , but if exists it will update all three timestamp options(atime, mtime, ctime)
touch -a filename (only to update atime and ctime)
touch -m filename (only to update mtime and ctime)
touch -a/-m -t 202501021010.13 (to set manually time depending on atime or mtime what have we set, to set the time 2025year, 01month, 02day, 10:10, 13seconds) applying -- NUMBER TIME FORMAT
touch -a/-m -d "2025-01-02 10:10:13" applying -- DATE TIME FORMAT
touch filename1 -r filename2 (for updating timestamp of filename1 by the timestamp of filename2)
